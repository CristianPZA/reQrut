/*
  # Temporarily disable RLS on user_profiles table
  
  1. Changes
    - Disable Row Level Security on user_profiles table
    - Create a basic policy to allow all operations for authenticated users
    
  2. Security
    - Table remains protected by requiring authentication
    - All authenticated users can perform CRUD operations
    - No recursive policies that could cause infinite loops
